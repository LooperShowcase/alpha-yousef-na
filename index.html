      Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and
      publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by Tim
      Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his
      parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Following his first commercial video
      game release, ZZT (1991), the company became Epic MegaGames, Inc. in early
      1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who has been its vice president since.
      Moving their headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was
      simplified to Epic Games
